        <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
        <h4>Devops Engineer !</h4>
        <p>
          I am Nilesh Sunil Kudale, currently in the final year of the
          Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering program at Pimpri
          Chinchwad College of Engineering. My background includes a farmer
          father and a homemaker mother. Although my academic focus has been on
          engineering, my passion lies in the IT domain. This has driven me to
          acquire a diverse skill set in various aspects of IT. My journey into
          the IT realm began with learning programming languages such as C++,
          Python, and Java, alongside delving into Data Structures and
          Algorithms using C++. I also dedicated time to comprehending
          fundamental computer science subjects like Computer Networks,
          Operating Systems, and Database Management Systems. My current
          trajectory is towards becoming a DevOps engineer. This involves
          mastering tools and technologies like Linux OS, Git, GitHub, Docker,
          Ansible, Jenkins, Maven, and Nagios. Notably, I've employed Docker and
          AWS, utilizing EBS, to deploy a browser-based 2048 game, marking my
          initial step into DevOps. My IT exploration didn't stop at backend
          technologiesâ€”I ventured into frontend development as well, gaining
          proficiency in HTML and CSS. This allowed me to craft web projects
          like a Spotify clone, a personal portfolio, and a calculator. My
          interests extended to creating domain-specific projects, including
          innovations like an automatic rain-sensing car wiper, a handheld heart
          rate monitoring system, and a Consumer Complaint Classification system
          utilizing various machine learning algorithms. Complementing my
          academic pursuits, I engaged in three virtual internships. At Exposis
          Data Labs, I crafted the frontend of an online burger selling website.
          The Eduskill internship familiarized me with AIML and foundational AWS
          services. Lastly, the Persistent summer internship broadened my
          expertise in Linux OS, DBMS, DSA, and Java core. My accomplishments
          are highlighted by being a two-time University topper at Coding
          Ninjas, securing the 2nd rank in the CodeXcelerate Contest hosted by
          CSI-MIET University, and achieving 2nd rank in the DSA Sprint contest
          organized by NIT Durgapur. Beyond academics, I am a sports enthusiast
          and was honored as a District Player in Volleyball in 2019. In the
          near term, my goal is to secure a DevOps-related internship, while my
          long-term aspiration is to establish myself as a successful DevOps
          Engineer commanding an attractive remuneration package.

                <p>
                    I obtained the code from a Git repository and crafted a Dockerfile to create a unified Docker image. 
                    After generating the image, I instantiated a container from it and confirmed its functionality in my browser. 
                    Since it was confined to my local environment, I opted to utilize AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EBS) to deploy the 
                    application. This transition allowed for broader accessibility.
